Mine is a misery which nothing can do away."</p><p>"You must not talk so, Marianne. Have you no comforts? no friends? Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation? Much as you suffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period;â€”if your engagement had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been, before he chose to put an end to it. Every additional day of unhappy confidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful."</p><p>"Engagement!" cried Marianne, "there has been no engagement."</p><p>"No engagement!"</p><p>"No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him. He has broken no faith with me."</p></div> </div>
