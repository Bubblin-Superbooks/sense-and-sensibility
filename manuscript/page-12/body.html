Upon the whole, therefore, it is most likely that the passage in Madame D'Arblay is a mere coincidence; and that in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, as well as in the novel that succeeded it in publication, Miss Austen, after the fashion of the old morality plays, simply substituted the leading characteristics of her principal personages for their names. Indeed, in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> the sense of Elinor, and the sensibility (or rather <em>sensiblerie</em>) of Marianne, are markedly emphasised in the opening pages of the book But Miss Austen subsequently, and, as we think, wisely, discarded in her remaining efforts the cheap attraction of an alliterative title. <em>Emma</em> and <em>Persuasion, Northanger Abbey</em> and <em>Mansfield Park</em>, are names far more in consonance with the quiet tone of her easy and unobtrusive art.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Elinor and Marianne</em> was originally written about</p></div> </div>
