But, my dear Elinor, what is the matter with Marianne?â€”she looks very unwell, has lost her colour, and is grown quite thin. Is she ill?"</p><p>"She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"I am sorry for that. At her time of life, any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever! Her's has been a very short one! She was as handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract the man. There  was something in her style of beauty, to please them particularly. I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond of <em>you</em>, but so it happened to strike her. She will be mistaken, however. I question whether Marianne <em>now</em>, will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if <em>you</em> do not do better. Dorsetshire! I know very little of Dorsetshire;</p></div> </div>
